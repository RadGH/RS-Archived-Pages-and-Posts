# RS Archived Pages and Posts (WordPress Plugin)
---

This WordPress plugin adds the ability to move a post or page to a separate "archive" post type. Archived items can be restored to their original post type at any time. While archived, these pages and posts can only be viewed by administrators.

Use the meta box shown below to move a post/page to the archive. If using the block editor, find the same meta box under the page settings:

When viewing an archived post, a similar meta box allows you to restore the item:
